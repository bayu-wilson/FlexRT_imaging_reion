# FlexRT code for "[Imaging reionization’s last phases with I-front Lyman-α emissions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14625v1)" 

Note that this is Bayu's version of FlexRT which was written by Christopher Cain. Details on the latest version of FlexRT is in the [code paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04521).

For more info about the plotting routines, see the repository for making the plots in the paper [here](https://github.com/bayu-wilson/imaging_ionization_fronts_plots).
