# FlexRT code for "[Imaging reionization’s last phases with I-front Lyman-α emissions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14625v1)" 

Note that this is Bayu's version of FlexRT which was written by Christopher Cain. Details on the latest version of FlexRT is in the [code paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04521). This repository is not documented fully and it does not include some of the data files necessary to run FlexRT out of the box. 

For more info about the plotting routines, see the repository for making the plots in the paper [here](https://github.com/bayu-wilson/imaging_ionization_fronts_plots).
